# Research Software Engineering with Python

## Introduction

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment.
The emphasis is on practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a relatively short course (8-10 half-day modules) which is intensive and involves hands-on exercises.

## Pre-requisites

* It would be helpful to have experience in at least one programming language (for example `C++`, `C`, `Fortran`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Matlab` or `R`) but this is not a requirement.
* Experience with version control and/or the `Unix` shell, for instance from Software Carpentry, would also be helpful.
* You should bring your own laptop to the course as there are several hands-on exercise for you to work through.
* We have provided [setup](session99/index.md) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on your computer.
* **Eligibility:** This course is primarily aimed at Turing-connected PhD students. Other Turing-affiliated people might join too if capacity allows.

## Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in `Python`.
We will assume you have prior experience with at least one programming language but `Python` syntax and usage will be introduced during this course.
However, this course is **not** intended to teach `Python` and you may find supplementary content useful.

## Evaluation

**None:** you are not graded. There are two exercises that you can use for self-assessment.

## Versions

You can browse through course notes as HTML or download them as a printable PDF via the navigation bar to the left.

**If you encounter any problem or bug in these materials**, please remember to add an issue to the [course repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rsd-engineeringcourse), explaining the problem and, potentially, its solution.
By doing this, you will improve the instructions for future users. 🎉
