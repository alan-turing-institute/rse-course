# Research Software Engineering with Python

## Introduction

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable, efficient research software in a collaborative environment.
The emphasis is on practical techniques, tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a relatively short course (8-10 half-day modules) which is intensive and involves hands-on exercises.

## Pre-requisites

- It would be helpful to have experience in at least one programming language (for example `C++`, `C`, `Fortran`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `Matlab` or `R`) but this is not a requirement.
- Experience with version control and/or the `Unix` shell, for instance from Software Carpentry, would also be helpful.
- You should bring your own laptop to the course as there are several hands-on exercise for you to work through.
- We have provided [setup](course_prerequisites/index.md) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on your computer.
- **Eligibility:** This course is primarily aimed at Turing-connected PhD students. Other Turing-affiliated people might join too if capacity allows.

## Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in `Python`.
We will assume you have prior experience with at least one programming language but `Python` syntax and usage will be introduced during this course.
However, this course is **not** intended to teach `Python` and you may find supplementary content useful.

### Solutions

**Note:** you are not graded.

Sample solutions to the exercises are available [here](solutions/index.md).

## Versions

You can browse through course notes as HTML, download them as a printable PDF via the navigation bar to the left, or clone the repo and run the notebooks (see the setup instructions).
