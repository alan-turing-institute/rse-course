##Introduction

### Purpose

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable,
efficient research software in a collaborative environment. The emphasis is on practical techniques,
tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a intensive, practical course.

## Course processes

###Prerequisites

Prior knowledge of at least one programming language, including variables, control flow, and functions.

###Exercises

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python.  
Python will be introduced during this course, but we will assume you can already
program. That means that you may find supplementary python content useful.

###Setup

You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are
 using do not have desktop computers.

We have provided [setup](installation) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on
your computer.
