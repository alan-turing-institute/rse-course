# Installation Instructions

## Introduction

This document contains instructions for installation of the packages we'll be using during the course.
You will be following the training on your own machines, so please complete these instructions.
The instructions include Windows, Mac and Linux specific sections.

**If you encounter any problem during insallation** and you manage to solve them (feel free to ask us for help), please remember to add an issue to the [course repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rsd-engineeringcourse), explaining the problem and solution.
By doing this you will be helping to improve the instructions for future users! ðŸŽ‰

## What we're installing

- the `Python` programming language (version `3.8` or greater) and `Conda`
- a selection of `Python` software packages that will be used during the course (via a Conda environment)
- `git` for the version control module
- a suitable text editor

Please ensure that you have a computer (ideally a laptop) with all of these installed. Even if you think you have all of these things already, it's worth reading through the sections below to make sure.

## Installing Python

Install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution for your operating system (OS).

Open a terminal (console) window and check whether the installation has worked. You will require version `3.8` or greater of Python and Anaconda should install the most recent one by default:

```bash
python --version
```

If the version of Python you have is < `3.8.x` or you experience some difficulties with Anaconda, there are alternative ways to install Python.
