## What we're installing

- the `Python` programming language (version `3.8` or greater) and `Conda`
- a selection of `Python` software packages that will be used during the course (via a Conda environment)
- `git` for the version control module
- a suitable text editor

Please ensure that you have a computer (ideally a laptop) with all of these installed. Even if you think you have all of these things already, it's worth reading through the prerequisite pages to make sure.
