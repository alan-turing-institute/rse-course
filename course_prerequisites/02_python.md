# Python

Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your OS. Then follow the instructions for [installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), which differ for Windows, Mac and Linux.

You should then test whether the installation has worked as expected by doing the following:

Open a terminal (console) window and check whether the installation has worked. You will require version `3.8` or greater of Python for the course and Anaconda should have installed the most recent version by default:

```bash
python --version
```

**Note:** If you're working in Windows and haven't used a terminal or console before, it may be simpler to return to this step after completing the Git installation instructions (which gives you a Git Bash console)
