How did they come to be? \\nThere are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products.\\nThere in wine is found the great generalization; all life is fermentation.\\nNobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, \\nas did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease.\\nHow vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it!\\nIf our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, \\ninto parts -- \\nphysics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on -- \\nremember that nature does not know it!\\n\\nSo let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for.\\nLet it give us one more final pleasure; drink it and forget it all!\\n   - Richard Feynman\\n\""
