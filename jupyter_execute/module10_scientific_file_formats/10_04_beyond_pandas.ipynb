    "If we really want to compress our data as much as possible for writing to disk, and we don't care about making it human readable, we can use further tricks such as delta compression.\n",
    "For time series data, if something is relatively smoothly varying, we can save a lot of space by storing just the difference from one data point to the next, rather than each value.\n",
    "As an illustration of how this could work: rather than storing all the dates in the \"date\" table of our dataframe, we could just store the first date, and then for every subsequent row we just store the number of days since the previous row.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where the column we're trying to compress contains integers or floats, we wouldn't save any space if we were to store the differences as integers or floats as well, but lots of clever schemes exist for packing small deltas within a few bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "`5, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "the deltas are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`-2, 0, 1, -2, -1, 1, -2`\n",
    "\n",
    "we can rescale this set of deltas by subtracting the minimum value (-2) from each element, such that the new minimum is 0, giving:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "and finally we can encode this \"block\" along with a \"header\", as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "header: 8 (block size), 5 (first value)\n",
    "block: -2 (minimum delta), 2 (bitwidth), 00101100011100b (0,2,3,0,1,3,0 packed on 2 bits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this trivial example, we are not actually saving that much space, but we could extend this to have many more blocks, and/or longer blocks, and/or have a block/miniblock structure (e.g. for when we need to change the bitwidth to deal with larger deltas), and the overall saving could be huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, doing all these compression steps by hand is fiddly, and we would be very likely to make a mistake!  But luckily, libraries exist that do the hard work for us, and can seamlessly convert between pandas DataFrames and compressed columnar formats."
