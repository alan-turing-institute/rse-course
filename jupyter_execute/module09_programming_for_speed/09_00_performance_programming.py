# # 9.0 Performance programming

# *Estimated time for this notebook: 10 minutes*

# We've spent most of this course looking at how to make code readable and reliable. For research work, it is often also important that code is efficient: that it does what it needs to do *quickly*.

# It is very hard to work out beforehand whether code will be efficient or not: it is essential to *Profile* code, to measure its performance, to determine what aspects of it are slow.

# When we looked at Functional programming, we claimed that code which is conceptualised in terms of actions on whole data-sets rather than individual elements is more efficient. Let's measure the performance of some different ways of implementing some code and see how they perform.

# ## Two Mandelbrots

# You're probably familiar with a famous fractal called the [Mandelbrot Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDU40eUcTj0).

# For a complex number $c$, $c$ is in the Mandelbrot set if the series $z_{i+1}=z_{i}^2+c$ (with $z_0=0$) does not tend to infinity.
# Traditionally, we plot a color showing how many steps are needed before $\left|z_i\right|>2$. At this point we are sure that $c$ is *not* in the Mandelbrot set as the series will diverge.

# Here's a trivial python implementation:

# In[1]:


def mandel1(position, limit=50):

    value = position

    while abs(value) < 2:
        limit -= 1
        value = value**2 + position
        if limit < 0:
            return 0

    return limit


# In[2]:


xmin = -1.5
ymin = -1.0
xmax = 0.5
ymax = 1.0
resolution = 300
xstep = (xmax - xmin) / resolution
ystep = (ymax - ymin) / resolution
xs = [(xmin + xstep * i) for i in range(resolution)]
ys = [(ymin + ystep * i) for i in range(resolution)]


# In[3]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('timeit', '', 'data = [[mandel1(complex(x, y)) for x in xs] for y in ys]\n')


# In[4]:


data1 = [[mandel1(complex(x, y)) for x in xs] for y in ys]


# In[5]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.set_cmap("cividis")  # use a CVD-friendly palette
plt.imshow(data1, interpolation="none", extent=[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax])


# We will learn this lesson how to make a version of this code which works Ten Times faster:

import numpy as np


# Do not worry about how this function works - it will be covered in detail later
def mandel_numpy(position, limit=50):
    value = position
    diverged_at_count = np.zeros(position.shape)
    while limit > 0:
        limit -= 1
        value = value**2 + position
        diverging = value * np.conj(value) > 4
        first_diverged_this_time = np.logical_and(diverging, diverged_at_count == 0)
        diverged_at_count[first_diverged_this_time] = limit
        value[diverging] = 2

    return diverged_at_count


# In[7]:


ymatrix, xmatrix = np.mgrid[ymin:ymax:ystep, xmin:xmax:xstep]


# In[8]:


values = xmatrix + 1j * ymatrix


# In[9]:


data_numpy = mandel_numpy(values)


# In[10]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

plt.imshow(data_numpy, interpolation="none", extent=[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax])


# In[11]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('timeit', '', 'data_numpy = mandel_numpy(values)\n')


# Note we get the same answer:

# In[12]:


(data_numpy == data1).all()
