# # Module 07: Bad Boids

# There's not a single "right" answer to how the code should be refacatored, but on the `better_boids` branch of the `bad-boids` repo we have an improved version of the code with changes based on all the ideas above. You can find it on GitHub here:
# 
# https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bad-boids/tree/better_boids 
# 
# You may also find it interesting to browse through the [history of commits](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bad-boids/commits/better_boids).
# 
# Alternatively, you can checkout the branch in your local clone:
# 
# ```
# git checkout better_boids
# ```
