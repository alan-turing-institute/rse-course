# # 6.9 Exercise: Packaging Troll Treasure

# We are going to look at a simplified version of a game with a [long history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus). Games of this kind have been used as test-beds for development of artificial intelligence.
# 
# A *dungeon* is a network of connected *rooms* on a square grid. One or more rooms contain *treasure*. Your character, the *adventurer*, moves between rooms, looking for the treasure.
# A *troll* is also in the dungeon and moves between rooms. If the troll catches the adventurer, you lose. If you find treasure before being eaten, you win. (In this simple version, we do not consider the need to leave the dungeon.)
# 
# The starting rooms for the adventurer and troll are given in the definition of the dungeon.
# 
# The way the adventurer and troll move is called a *strategy*. Different strategies are more or less likely to succeed. There are two strategies in the provided code - random movement, and movement controlled by human input.
# 
# The code provides a function to play a single game, or to simulate many games and estimate the probability the adventurer or troll wins.
# 
# In this exercise, you will convert the code provided in this Jupyter notebook into a proper Python package.

# ## What to do
# 
# Using the course material from this module to help:
# 
# **1.** Briefly familiarise yourself with the code below and how it works/runs, focusing on the different classes and functions that are defined rather than the implementation details. And try running a game in the notebook (see the [Playing Games](#playing-games) section).
# 
# **2.** Make a directory for your project
# 
# 
# **3.** Create a directory to contain your package (in your project directory) and copy the code from this notebook to it using multiple `.py` files. Remember to add `__init__.py` file(s).
# 
# 
# **4.** Create a `pyproject.toml` file to specify the metadata and dependencies for the package. The dependencies are [PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) version 6.0 and [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/) version 5.7.
# 
# 
# **5.** Create a virtual environment and activate it
# 
# 
# **6.** Install the package in your virtual environment.
# 
# 
# **7.** Check that you can import your package and run a script to play a game.
# 
# 
# **8.** Make a command-line interface:
#   - Use `argparse` to create a function that can be called from the command-line with the path to a dungeon YAML file, and the option to either run a single game or calculate probabilities.
#   - Add a script to call your function to the `[project.scripts]` section of `pyproject.toml`
#   - Reinstall your package and verify the executable you defined can now be run from a terminal.
# 
# ### Extensions
# 
# If you'd like to take this further here are some other things you could try, depending on your interests:
# 
# **9.** Create a GitHub repo for your project. Try installing the package from GitHub.
# 
# 
# **10.** Add `README`, `LICENSE`, and `CITATION` files to your project directory.
# 
# 
# **11.** Improve documentation
#   - Add docstrings to functions to explain what they do, their inputs, and outputs (e.g. in numpydoc format)
#   - Build a documentaion web-site with sphinx
#   - Host the documentation on GitHub pages
# 
# **12.** Add unit tests
#   - Write unit tests, such as to verify the outcomes of the provided `test_xxx.yml` dungeon files.
#   - Add `pytest` as a development dependency for your package (and install it)
#   - Run the tests and verify they pass
# 
# 
# **13.** Improve or extend the code (you may like to revisit this after the next module):
#   - Specify your own dungeons or create a function to auto-generate them
#   - Create new movement behaviour classes for adventurers and trolls
#   - Look for places the code could be refactored (to reduce repetition, for example)
#
