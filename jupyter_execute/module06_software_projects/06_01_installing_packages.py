# # 6.1 Installing libraries

# *Estimated time for this notebook: 10 minutes*

# We've seen that there are lots of python libraries. But how do we install them?

# The main problem is this: *libraries need other libraries*

# So you can't just install a library by copying code to the computer: you'll find yourself wandering down a tree
# of "dependencies"; libraries needed by libraries needed by the library you want.

# This is actually a good thing; it means that people are making use of each others'
# code. There's a real problem in scientific programming, of people who think they're really clever writing their own
# twenty-fifth version of the same thing.

# So using other people's libraries is good.

# Why don't we do it more? Because it can often be quite difficult to **install** other peoples' libraries!

# Python has developed a good tool for avoiding this: **pip**.

# ## Installing scikit-learn using pip

# On a computer you control, on which you have installed python via Anaconda, you will need to open a **terminal**
# to invoke the library-installer program, `pip`.

# * On windows, go to start->all programs->Anaconda->Anaconda Command Prompt
# * On mac, start *terminal*. 
# * On linux, open a bash shell.

# Into this shell, type:
#     
# `pip install scikit-learn`

# The computer will install the package automatically from PyPI. 

# Now, close the Jupyter notebook if you have it open, and reopen it. Check your new library is installed with:

# In[1]:


from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

wine = load_wine()
X = wine.data
y = wine.target
feature_names = wine.feature_names


# In[2]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

# Find the column index of two features to plot
color_idx = feature_names.index("color_intensity")
proline_idx = feature_names.index("proline")

# Plot the training points
plt.scatter(X[:, color_idx], X[:, proline_idx], c=y, edgecolor="k")
plt.xlabel("Color Intensity")
plt.ylabel("Proline")

plt.xticks(())
plt.yticks(())


# That was actually pretty easy, I hope. This is how you'll install new libraries when you need them.

# Troubleshooting:
#     
# On mac or linux, you *might* get a complaint that you need "superuser", "root", or "administrator" access. If so type:
# 
# * `pip install --user scikit-learn`
# 
# and enter your password.
#     
# If you get a complaint like: 'pip is not recognized as an internal or external command', try the following:
#         
# * `conda install pip` (if you are using conda)
# * or follow the [official instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line) otherwise
# 
# Ask one of the instructors/helpers if you're having difficulties, or open an issue in [the course repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/rse-course/issues).

# ## Where do these libraries go? 

# In[3]:


import numpy

numpy.__path__


# Your computer will be configured to keep installed Python packages in a particular place.

# Python knows where to look for possible library installations in a list of places, called the "PythonPath".
# It will try each of these places in turn, until it finds a matching library name.

# In[4]:


import sys

sys.path


# ## Libraries not on PyPI
# 
# Sometimes library code you want to use won't be available on PyPI. In that case there are a few options:

# ### The library is available on another package index
# 
# For example, some libraries not on PyPI are available with `conda` (see details below).

# ### The library is in a git repo
# 
# If the library is available on GitHub or another service hosting git repos, `pip` can install it from the repo instead of PyPI:
# 
# ```bash
# pip install git+https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime.git
# ```
# 
# This could also be an option if you need a development version of a library that hasn't been released yet.
# 
# (NB: `sktime` is also available [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sktime/), we just use it as an example here).

# ### Download and install locally
# 
# Sometimes you'll need to download the source code directly, or to test the installation of a library you're working on yourself. To do this, download the code, then,  in a terminal:
# 
# ```bash
# cd <path_to_library_code>  # change to the code directory
# pip install .  # install the library at the current path
# ```
# 

# ## Installing binary dependencies with conda
# 
# `pip` is the usual Python tool for installing libraries. But there's one area of library installation that is still awkward:
# some python libraries depend not on other **python** libraries, but on libraries in C++ or Fortran.

# This can cause you to run into difficulties installing some libraries. 
# Fortunately, Anaconda provide a carefully managed set of scripts for installing lots of these awkward non-python libraries too. You can do this with the `conda` command line tool, if you're using Anaconda.

# Simply type
# 
# ```bash
# conda install <whatever>
# ```
# 
# instead of `pip install`. This will fetch the python package not from PyPI, but from Anaconda's distribution for your platform, and manage any non-python dependencies too.

# Typically, if you're using Anaconda, whenever you come across a python package you want, you should check if Anaconda package it first using `conda search` (or [this list in the documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/)). If it is there you can `conda install` it, you'll likely have less problems. But Anaconda doesn't package everything, so you'll need to pip install from time to time.
# 
# The maintainers of packages may have also provided releases of their software via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), a community-driven project that provides a collection of packages for the anaconda environment. In such cases you can [add conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/#about) to your anaconda installation and use search and install as explained above.

# ## Other Distribution tools
# 
# Distribution tools allow one to obtain a working copy of someone else's package. 
# 
# Language-specific tools:
# 
# - Python: [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)
# - R: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
# - Ruby: [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/)
# - Perl: [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/)
# 
# Platform-specific packagers:
# 
# - Ubuntu and Debian: [dpkg](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html) for `apt-get` 
# - Redhat and Fedora: [rpm](https://rpm.org/) for `yum`
# - Mac OS: [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
# - Windows: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)
# 
# If you're working in a compiled language like C++ or Fortran, there's often no language specific repository. You'll need to write platform installers for as many platforms as you want to support.
