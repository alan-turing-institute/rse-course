# Why is Python so popular for research work?

# Historically, FORTRAN was the most popular "language of technical computing".
# Later, MATLAB was created with strong built-in support for efficient numerical analysis with matrices (the *mat* in MATLAB is for Matrix, not Maths), and plotting.
# 
# Early Python users developed three critical libraries, to match the power of MATLAB for scientific work:
# - Matplotlib, the plotting library created by [John D. Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter)
# - NumPy, a fast matrix maths library created by [Travis Oliphant](https://www.anaconda.com/people/travis-oliphant)
# - IPython, the precursor of the notebook, created by [Fernando Perez](http://fperez.org)

# By combining a plotting library, a matrix maths library, and an easy-to-use interface allowing live plotting commands in a persistent environment, the powerful capabilities of MATLAB were matched by a free and open toolchain.

# Further tools such as `pandas` and `scipy` are built on, extend, or utilise these libraries.
# In this module we will use these libraries to deal with data of the type that might be used in a research project.
