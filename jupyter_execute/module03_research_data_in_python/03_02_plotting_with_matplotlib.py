# # 3.2 Plotting with Matplotlib
# *Estimated time to complete this notebook: 25 minutes*

# ## 3.2.1 Importing Matplotlib

# We import the 'pyplot' object from Matplotlib, which provides us with an interface for making figures. We usually abbreviate it.

# In[1]:


from matplotlib import pyplot as plt


# ## 3.2.2 Notebook magics

# When we write:

# In[2]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# We tell the Jupyter notebook to show figures we generate alongside the code that created it, rather than in a
# separate window. Lines beginning with a single percent are not python code: they control how the notebook deals with python code.

# Lines beginning with two percent signs are "cell magics", that tell Jupyter notebook how to interpret the particular cell;
# we've seen `%%writefile` and `%%bash` for example.

# ## 3.2.3 A basic plot

# When we write:

# In[3]:


from math import sin, cos, pi

myfig = plt.plot([sin(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)])


# The plot command *returns* a figure, just like the return value of any function. The notebook then displays this.

# To add a title, axis labels etc, we need to get that figure object, and manipulate it. 
# For convenience, matplotlib allows us to do this just by issuing commands to change the "current figure":

# In[4]:


plt.plot([sin(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)])
plt.title("Hello")


# But this requires us to keep all our commands together in a single cell, and makes use of a "global" single "current plot",
# which, while convenient for quick exploratory sketches, is a bit cumbersome. To produce from our notebook proper plots
# to use in papers, Python's plotting library, matplotlib, defines some types we can use to treat individual figures as variables,
# and manipulate these.

# ## 3.2.4 Figures and Axes

# We often want multiple graphs in a single figure (e.g. for figures which display a matrix of graphs of different variables for comparison).

# So Matplotlib divides a `figure` object up into axes: each pair of axes is one 'subplot'. 
# To make a boring figure with just one pair of axes, however, we can just ask for a default new figure, with
# brand new axes. The relevant function returns a (figure, axis) pair, which we can deal out with parallel assignment. 

# In[5]:


sine_graph, sine_graph_axes = plt.subplots()


# Once we have some axes, we can plot a graph on them:

# In[6]:


sine_graph_axes.plot([sin(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)], label="sin(x)")


# We can add a title to a pair of axes:

# In[7]:


sine_graph_axes.set_title("My graph")


# In[8]:


sine_graph_axes.set_ylabel("f(x)")


# In[9]:


sine_graph_axes.set_xlabel("100 x")


# Now we need to actually display the figure. As always with the notebook, if we make a variable be returned by the last
# line of a code cell, it gets displayed:

# In[10]:


sine_graph


# We can add another curve:

# In[11]:


sine_graph_axes.plot([cos(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)], label="cos(x)")


# In[12]:


sine_graph


# A legend will help us distinguish the curves:

# In[13]:


sine_graph_axes.legend()


# In[14]:


sine_graph


# ## 3.2.5 Saving figures

# We must be able to save figures to disk, in order to use them in papers. This is really easy:

# In[15]:


sine_graph.savefig("my_graph.png")


# In order to be able to check that it worked, we need to know how to display an arbitrary image in the notebook.

# The programmatic way is like this:

# In[16]:


from IPython.display import Image # Get the notebook's own library for manipulating itself.

Image(filename="my_graph.png")


# ## 3.2.6 Subplots

# We might have wanted the $\sin$ and $\cos$ graphs on separate axes:

# In[17]:


double_graph = plt.figure()


# In[18]:


sin_axes = double_graph.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)  # 2 rows, 1 column, 1st subplot


# In[19]:


cos_axes = double_graph.add_subplot(2, 1, 2)


# In[20]:


double_graph


# In[21]:


sin_axes.plot([sin(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)])


# In[22]:


sin_axes.set_ylabel("sin(x)")


# In[23]:


cos_axes.plot([cos(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)])


# In[24]:


cos_axes.set_ylabel("cos(x)")


# In[25]:


cos_axes.set_xlabel("100 x")


# In[26]:


double_graph


# ## 3.2.7 Versus plots

# When we specify a single `list` to `plot`, the x-values are just the array index number. We usually want to plot something
# more meaningful:

# In[27]:


double_graph = plt.figure()
sin_axes = double_graph.add_subplot(2, 1, 1)
cos_axes = double_graph.add_subplot(2, 1, 2)
cos_axes.set_ylabel("cos(x)")
sin_axes.set_ylabel("sin(x)")
cos_axes.set_xlabel("x")


# In[28]:


sin_axes.plot(
    [x / 100.0 for x in range(100)], [sin(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)]
)
cos_axes.plot(
    [x / 100.0 for x in range(100)], [cos(pi * x / 100.0) for x in range(100)]
)

# ## 3.2.8 Sunspot Data

# We can incorporate what we have learned in the sunspots example to produce graphs of the data.

# In[30]:


import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('http://www.sidc.be/silso/INFO/snmtotcsv.php',
                    sep=";",
                    header=None,
                    names=["year", "month", "date", "mean", "deviation", "observations", "definitive"])
df.head()


# We can plot all the data in the dataframe seperately, but that isn't always useful!

# In[31]:


df.plot(subplots=True);


# And can produce more meaningful and useful visualisations either with our generated lists or by accessing the dataframe directly

# In[32]:


deviation = df['deviation'].tolist() # Get the dataframe column (series) as a list
observations = df['observations'].tolist()
mean = df['mean'].tolist()
date = df['date'].tolist()


# In[33]:


fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,10)) #Set the width of the figure to be 15 inches, and the height to be 5 inches

ax1 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,1) # 2 rows, 2 columns, 1st subplot
ax1.errorbar(df['date'], # Date on the x axis
             df['mean'], # Mean on the y axis
             yerr=df['deviation'], # Use the deviation for the error bars
             color = 'orange', # Plot the sunspot (mean) data in orange
             ecolor='black') # Show the error bars in black
ax1.set_xlabel('Date')
ax1.set_ylabel('Mean')
ax1.set_title('From Dataframe')

ax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,2)  # 2 rows, 2 columns, 2nd subplot
ax2.scatter(df['date'],
            df['observations'],
            color='grey',
            marker='+')
ax2.set_xlabel('Date')
ax2.set_ylabel('Number of Observations')
ax2.set_title('From Dataframe')

ax3 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,3) # 2 rows, 2 columns, 3rd subplot
ax3.errorbar(date,
             mean,
             yerr = deviation,
             color = 'pink',
             ecolor = 'black')
ax3.set_xlabel('Date')
ax3.set_ylabel('Mean')
ax3.set_title('From List')

ax4 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,4) # 2 rows, 2 columns, 4th subplot
ax4.scatter(date, observations, color = 'red', marker = 'o')
ax4.set_xlabel('Date')
ax4.set_ylabel('Number of Observations')
ax4.set_title('From List')


# In this example we are plotting columns from the Pandas DataFrame (series), and from lists to show this method works for both. Numpy arrays can also be used.

# ## 3.2.9 Learning More

# There's so much more to learn about `matplotlib`: pie charts, bar charts, heat maps, 3-d plotting, animated plots, and so on. You can learn all this via the [Matplotlib Website](https://matplotlib.org/stable/).
# You should try to get comfortable with all this, so please use some time in class, or at home, to work your way through a bunch of the [examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html).
