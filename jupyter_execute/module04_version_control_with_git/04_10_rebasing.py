# # 4.10 Rebasing

# *Estimated time to complete this notebook: 10 minutes*

# ## Rebase vs merge
# 
# A git *merge* is only one of two ways to get someone else's work into yours.
# The other is called a rebase.
# 
# In a merge, a revision is added, which brings the branches together.
# Both histories are retained.
# In a rebase, git tries to work out
# 
# > What would you need to have done, to make your changes, if your colleague had already made theirs?
# 
# Git will invent some new revisions, and the result will be a repository with an apparently linear history.
# This can be useful if you want a cleaner, non-branching history, but it has the risk of creating inconsistencies, since you are, in a way, "rewriting" history.

# ## An example rebase
# 
# We've built a repository to help visualise the difference between a merge and a rebase, at https://github.com/UCL-RITS/wocky_rebase/blob/master/wocky.md.
# 
# The initial state of both collaborators is a text file, wocky.md:
# 
# ```
# It was clear and cold,
# and the slimy monsters
# ```

# On the master branch, a second commit ('Dancing') has been added:

# ```
# It was clear and cold,
# and the slimy monsters
# danced and spun in the waves
# ```

# On the "Carollian" branch, a commit has been added translating the initial state into Lewis Caroll's language:
# 
# ```
# 'Twas brillig,
# and the slithy toves
# ```

# So the logs look like this:

# ```bash
# git log --oneline --graph master
# ```
# 
# ```
# * 2a74d89 Dancing
# * 6a4834d Initial state
# ```
# 
# ```bash
# git log --oneline --graph carollian
# ```
# 
# ```
# * 2232bf3 Translate into Caroll's language
# * 6a4834d Initial state
# ```

# If we now **merge** carollian into master, the final state will include both changes:

# ```
# 'Twas brillig,
# and the slithy toves
# danced and spun in the waves
# ```
# 

# But the graph shows a divergence and then a convergence:

# ```
# git log --oneline --graph
# ```
# 
# ```
# *   b41f869 Merge branch 'carollian' into master_merge_carollian
# |\
# | * 2232bf3 Translate into Caroll's language
# * | 2a74d89 Dancing
# |/
# * 6a4834d Initial state
# ```

# But if we **rebase**, the final content of the file is still the same, but the graph is different:

# ``` bash
# git log --oneline --graph master_rebase_carollian
# ```
# 
# ```
# * df618e0 Dancing
# * 2232bf3 Translate into Caroll's language
# * 6a4834d Initial state
# ```

# We have essentially created a new history, in which our changes come after the ones in the carollian branch.
# Note that, in this case, the hash for our "Dancing" commit has changed (from `2a74d89` to `df618e0`)!
# 
# To trigger the rebase, we did:
# 
# ``` bash
# git checkout master
# git rebase carollian
# ```
# 
# If this had been a remote, we would merge it with:
# 
# ``` bash
# git pull --rebase
# ```

# ## Fast Forwards
# 
# If we want to continue with the translation, and now want to merge the rebased branch into the carollian branch,
# we get:
# 
# ```bash
# git checkout carollian
# git merge master
# ```
# 
# 
# ``` bash
# Updating 2232bf3..df618e0
# Fast-forward
#  wocky.md | 1 +
#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
# ```
# 
# The master branch was already **rebased on** the carollian branch, so this merge was just a question of updating *metadata* (moving the label for the carollian branch so that it points to the same commit master does): a "fast forward".

# ## Rebasing pros and cons
# 
# Some people like the clean, apparently linear history that rebase provides.
# 
# But *rebase rewrites history*.
# 
# If you've already pushed, or anyone else has got your changes, things will get screwed up.
# 
# If you know your changes are still secret, it might be better to rebase to keep the history clean.
# If in doubt, just merge.

# # Squashing
# 
# A second way to use the `git rebase` command is to rebase your work on top of one of *your own* earlier commits,
# in interactive mode (`-i`). A common use of this is to "squash" several commits that should really be one, i.e. combine them into a single commit that contains all their changes:

# ``` bash
# git log
# ```
# 
# ```
# ea15 Some good work
# ll54 Fix another typo
# de73 Fix a typo
# ab11 A great piece of work
# cd27 Initial commit
# ```

# ## Using rebase to squash
# 
# If we type
# 
# ``` bash
# git rebase -i ab11 # OR HEAD~~
# ```
# 
# an edit window pops up with:

# ```
# pick cd27 Initial commit
# pick ab11 A great piece of work
# pick de73 Fix a typo
# pick ll54 Fix another typo
# pick ea15 Some good work
# 
# # Rebase 60709da..30e0ccb onto 60709da
# #
# # Commands:
# #  p, pick = use commit
# #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# ```

# We can rewrite select commits to be merged, so that the history is neater before we push.
# This is a great idea if you have lots of trivial typo commits.

# ```
# pick cd27 Initial commit
# pick ab11 A great piece of work
# squash de73 Fix a typo
# squash ll54 Fix another typo
# pick ea15 Some good work
# ```
# 
# save the interactive rebase config file, and rebase will build a new history:
# 
# ``` bash
# git log
# ```
# 
# ```
# de82 Some good work
# fc52 A great piece of work
# cd27 Initial commit
# ```

# Note the commit hash codes for 'Some good work' and 'A great piece of work' have changed,
# as the change they represent has changed.
