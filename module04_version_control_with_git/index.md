## Exercises

Classroom exercises are included inline in the modules.
We recommend that instructors schedule the exercises to be done in groups during breaks in the taught content.
However, it is **important** that participants also have some time away from their screens.
Exercises can also be left as self-paced homework assignments if preferred.
