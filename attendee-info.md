### Prerequisites

Prior knowledge of at least one programming language, including variables, control flow, and functions.

### Preparation

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python.
Python will be introduced during this course, but we will assume you can already
program. That means that you may find supplementary python content useful.

### Setup

You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are using do not have desktop computers.

We have provided [setup](installation) instructions for installing the software needed for the course on
your computer.

###Versions

The [notes](notes.pdf) are also available in  a printable pdf format.
