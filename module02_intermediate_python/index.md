## Exercises

Classroom exercises are grouped together at the end of the module: [2.7 Classroom Exercises](02_07_classroom_exercises.ipynb).
Each exercise is labelled with any sections whose contents are relevant.
We recommend that instructors schedule the exercises to be done in groups during breaks in the taught content.
However, it is **important** that participants also have some time away from their screens.
Exercises can also be left as self-paced homework assignments if preferred.
