## Exercises

A classroom exercise is included at the end of the module: [7.8 Exercise: Refactoring The Bad Boids](07_08_refactoring_boids.ipynb).
We recommend that instructors arrange for the exercise to be done in groups.
The exercise can also be left as a self-paced homework assignment if preferred.
