# Python

Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your OS.
Then follow the instructions for [installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), which differ for Windows, macOS and Linux.

You should test whether the installation has worked as expected by doing the following:

- Open a terminal (console) window and run the following:

```bash
python --version
```

**Note:** Anaconda should have installed the most recent version by default but note that you will require version `3.8` or greater of Python for the course.
