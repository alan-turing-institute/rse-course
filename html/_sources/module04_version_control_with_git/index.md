## Teaching notes

If you are teaching this course, please remove any `.gitconfig` files you might have in your home directory.
It is fine to restore them once you've finished teaching but you may otherwise have settings that interfere with the examples shown here.

## Exercises

Classroom exercises are included inline in the module.
We recommend that instructors schedule the exercises to be done in groups during breaks in the taught content.
However, it is **important** that participants also have some time away from their screens.
Exercises can also be left as self-paced homework assignments if preferred.
