    "\n",
    "* Fork and Pull Request are things happening only on the repository's server side (GitHub in our case). Consequently, you can't do things like `git fork` or `git pull-request` from the local copy of a repository.\n",
    "* You don't always need to fork repositories with the intention of contributing. You can fork a library you use, install it manually on your computer, and add more functionality or customise the existing one, so that it is more useful for you and your team.\n",
    "* Numpy's example is only illustrative. Normally, Open Source projects have in their documentation (sometimes in the form of a wiki) a set of instructions you need to follow if you want to contribute to their software.\n",
    "* Pull Requests can also be done for merging branches in a non-forked repository. It's typically used in teams to merge code from a branch into the master branch and ask team colleagues for code reviews before merging.\n",
    "* It's a good practice before starting a fork and a pull request to have a look at existing forks and pull requests. On GitHub, you can find the list of pull requests on the horizontal menu on the top of the page. Try to also find the network graph displaying all existing forks of a repo, like this example in the NumpyDoc repo: https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc/network"
